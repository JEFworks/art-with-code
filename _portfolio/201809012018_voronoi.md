"Low poly art" refers to a style where ["simple geometric shapes placed side-by-side to create angular, often minimalist, compositions"](https://www.sessions.edu/notes-on-design/whats-the-deal-with-low-poly-art/) remniscent of low polygonal resolution renders in 3D animations. The style can be tedious to create manually, so I attempted to automate generation of such "low poly art" using [Voronoi tesslation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram). A Voronoi tessellation partions a plane into regions, which are inherently just polygons, based on the distances among points in a specific subset of the plane such that for a seed point, its corresponding region consists of all points closer to that seed than to any other.

As a demonstration, we can use the `dismo` package to generate a Voronoi tesselation from a set of random points. 

{% highlight r %}
# install.packages('dismo')
library(dismo)

############# Random points
set.seed(0)
## generate random points
## increase number of points to increase resolution
p <- cbind(runif(1000), runif(1000)) 
## make voronoi
v <- voronoi(p)
## random rainbow colors
cols <- rainbow(length(v$id), s = 0.8, v = 1) 
## plot
par(mfrow=c(1,1), mar=rep(0,4))
plot(v, col=cols[v$id], border=FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

<div align="center">
    <img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/img/voronoi_rand.jpg' style='max-width:50%' />
</div>

We can color the regions or polygons randomly as shown above, or we can also sample the colors from an image.

{% highlight r %}
############# Borrow colors from image
library(jpeg)
## sample image
img <- readJPEG(system.file("img", "Rlogo.jpg", package="jpeg")) 
## map points positions to colors from image
pcol <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:nrow(p), function(i) {
  x <- floor(p[i,1]*(nrow(img)-1))+1
  y <- floor(p[i,2]*(ncol(img)-1))+1
  col <- rgb(img[x,y,1], img[x,y,2], img[x,y,3], maxColorValue=max(img)) 
  return(c(x, y, col))
}))
## plot original image using points
plot(as.numeric(pcol[,1]), as.numeric(pcol[,2]), col=pcol[,3], pch=16)
## plot voronoi with colors sampled from image
plot(v, col=pcol[,3], border=FALSE)		
{% endhighlight %}

Generated images for different sets of points (of varying density) are shown below. 

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/voronoi_2.jpg"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/voronoi_3.jpg"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/voronoi_4.jpg"/>
</div>

This begins to look more like the 'low poly' art style. Additional enhancements can be made by placing points in an image-aware manner, rather than randomly as it is current done. Points can be placed more densely in regions with rapid intensity change (perhaps as quantified by a [Laplacian](http://www.aishack.in/tutorials/sobel-laplacian-edge-detectors/)) to ensure regions with high levels of detail are represented by more polygons. This enhancement will be left as an exercise to the reader.
