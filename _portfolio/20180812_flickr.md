Thumbnail photo was generated using 20 photos with tags for each of the seasons. Mockup photo was generated using photos with tags for different flowers. 
Though I currently limit the number of photos per tag word, it would definitely be cool to apply too ALL publicly available images, maybe sorting by date taken, to get a sense for how colors change with the seasons or with climate, etc.
